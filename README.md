# Grand Wizard Tournament

An educational roguelike game that teaches programming concepts through an engaging magical combat system

## üìñ Description

Grand Wizard Tournament is an innovative educational game that teaches programming concepts through the fantasy lens of spellcrafting. Players navigate a procedurally generated magical labyrinth, battling waves of enemies while learning fundamental programming concepts through a visual spell-creation system.

In the world of Grand Wizard Tournament, the discovery of "Whispering Oracles" (a metaphor for AI tools) has made spellcasting too easy, with young wizards asking for spells without understanding the underlying principles. The Grand Wizard Council has created this tournament where Oracles don't function, forcing wizards to rely on their foundational knowledge.

The game seamlessly integrates computational thinking, algorithmic reasoning, and programming principles into the gameplay mechanics. As players create increasingly complex spells, they naturally absorb these concepts in an engaging and entertaining environment.

## üåü Key Features

- **Visual Spell-Crafting Editor**: Design spells using an intuitive node-based programming interface inspired by Scratch and Unreal Engine Blueprints
- **Procedurally Generated Labyrinth**: Explore a dynamic 3√ó3√ó3 magical maze with rooms that can be rotated and reconfigured
- **Progressive Learning System**: Master programming concepts through a natural difficulty curve from basic sequencing to complex logic and loops
- **Diverse Room Types**: Discover combat chambers, treasure vaults, magical shops, and puzzle rooms
- **Comprehensive Equipment System**: Collect wands, hats, and robes that enhance your wizard's abilities
- **Educational Analytics**: Track your progress in mastering programming concepts with detailed performance metrics

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Educational Concepts

Grand Wizard Tournament teaches fundamental programming concepts through gameplay mechanics:

- **Sequential Logic**: Arrange spell components in order to create magical effects
- **Conditional Statements**: Implement IF-THEN-ELSE logic using condition nodes for situationally adaptive spells
- **Variables & Data Management**: Store and manipulate spell properties through variable nodes
- **Loops & Iteration**: Create sustained or repeated magical effects using loop constructs
- **Functional Abstraction**: Build reusable spell modules that combine into more complex spells

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

The game is built with a modular architecture using Unreal Engine and C++:

- **Spell System**: Node-based visual programming interface with spell execution context
- **Level Generation**: Procedural room generation with different room types and connectivity
- **Enemy AI**: Intelligent enemy behavior with pathfinding and adaptive combat strategies
- **Progression System**: Player advancement through experience and skill improvement
- **Educational Tracking**: Analytics system to monitor learning progress

## üîÑ Core Game Loop

1. Navigate procedurally generated rooms
2. Collect spell components and items
3. Craft and modify spells using visual programming
4. Complete wave-specific objectives
5. Progress through increasingly challenging waves
6. Compete for high scores and rankings

## üöß Development Status

This project is currently in active development. The core spell system and character mechanics are implemented, with ongoing work on level generation, enemy AI, and the educational tracking system.

## üß™ Technologies Used

- **Engine**: Unreal Engine 5
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Target Platforms**: Windows, Linux

## üéÆ Gameplay Systems

### ü™Ñ Spell-Crafting System: "The Grimoire"

Players create spells by connecting different types of nodes:
- **Magic Nodes**: Core spell functionality (fire, ice, lightning)
- **Trigger Nodes**: Event-based triggers (on cast, on hit, timer-based)
- **Effect Nodes**: Actions produced by spells (damage, healing, teleportation)
- **Condition Nodes**: Logic control (if statements, health checks)
- **Variable Nodes**: Data storage and manipulation
- **Flow Nodes**: Loops and branches for repetition and control flow

### üë§ Character System

Players can customize their wizard through equipment and progression:
- **Stats**: Health, mana, casting speed, movement speed
- **Equipment Slots**: Wand, hat, robe, and accessory slots that modify capabilities
- **Progression**: Gain experience to unlock new spell components and abilities
